# JavaZone Indexer

To start ElasticSearch locally - run

```
elasticsearch --config=config/elasticsearch.yml
```

Still to be done:

* Make elasticsearch URL configurable - or at least support localhost and production
* Handle speakers
* Dynamic mappings for raw field perhaps
* Session should know it's conference (and likely speaker it's session(s)).
