    "content": "\"Functional Programming\" is the modern received wisdom regarding program and language design. All the cool kids talk about writing code that is \"functional\" or even \"purely functional\". However, functional programming as it is traditionally defined really doesn't cut the mustard, and if you look at how modern functional architectures are being shaped, everyone seems to have tacitly arrived at the same conclusion: more is needed.\n\nIn this talk, we will look at how modern functional languages like Scala, Clojure and even Haskell have evolved beyond the simple paradigms of the lambda calculus. We will see how the industry has really moved beyond functional programming and into the realm of something more powerful, more expressive and better suited to the task of large application architecture.",

You'll never have to lose a programming argument again once you've learned where to casually toss terms like \"applicative functor\" and \"Kleisli triple\" into the conversation.\n\nThis is the War of the Hipsters.

It also enables new scenarios where traditional code generation techniques would not be feasible, like consuming massive data sets such as Freebase.com or statistical data from The World Bank, all in a statically typed way with benefits such as statement completion and compile time checking.\n\nThe last part of the presentation will discuss planned features for Macros that will enable similar scenarios in future versions of Scala.",
