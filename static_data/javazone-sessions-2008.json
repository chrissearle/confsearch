Kundene forventer lik (eller bedre) sikkerhet på applikasjonen når den er på en mobiltelefon som når den er på en vanlig PC. Java ME er kjent for ha en svært strikt sikkerhetspolitikk med høy grad av ”sandboxing”, men er dette nok for å lage en sikker applikasjon? Hva er det egentlig som skal til for å lage en sikker applikasjon, og har Java ME det som trengs? Hva med \"write once, run everywhere”?\n\nForedraget vil gi en oversikt over hvordan man lager sikre applikasjoner i Java ME med innslag av nyttige erfaringer og fallgruver.",

Implementing various application concerns(1) generically(2) has enabled me to reuse the implementations across projects.\n\n* (1) concerns:  such as forms construction, validation, ui navigation, search, authorization\n* (2) generically:  in such a fashion that the implementation is decoupled from, or agnostic from the application's domain\n\nSpecifically, I have constructed a framework that enables a very high degree of reuse, whereby I reduce application development to little more than defining the domain.  Where implementations of the persistence, user interface, and other concerns can be reused across differing applications.  In this talk, I will be sharing with you my experiences with this approach, and the results it has yielded.  Live demonstrations of the various reusable features will be given.",

This section will show how we unconsciously collapse our ap- plication structures by using design patterns to increase flexibility and let rigidity creep in to our designs.  ~5 minutes.\n* The Strategy Pattern. The Strategy pattern enables us to select algorithms at runtime, but this comes with at the cost of forcing classes to have knowledge about the contexts in which these algorithms are used. Focusing on the implementation of a commonly used pattern drives attention to- wards how we can implement the same pattern with different means, which will be one of the themes for the rest of the talk.\n* The Collapse of Application Structure. Our implementations of common design patterns causes a ΄pattern lock-in‘ that can fragment domain logic and blur out the distinction between domain and in- frastructure logic. This can hurt the maintainability of our applications.  Making Roles Explicit. This section will focus on improving the design of a domain model’s internals to achieve better separation of concerns and improved flexibility and maintainability.  ~15 minutes\n* Our Objects Play Too Many Roles. Our domain objects, especially Aggregates, often violate sound software engineering principles. The upside of this is that it gives developers using these a better experience, the downside is that it hurts maintainability.  In this section I will show how the common validation patterns we use in our models violates the single responsibility principle and eschew domain concepts.\n* Refactoring to Explicit Roles. In this section I will show how to separate the concerns in the previ- ous section into domain objects and services that adhere to the single responsibility principle and makes the solution more extensible.\n* Data Access is Infrastructure.  This section will focus on improving the architecture of an application by clearly distinguishing between domain logic and infrastructure code. Towards the end we connect the dots by combining the lessons from this section with the ones form the previous section.  ~20 minutes\n* Don’t Repeat Yourself! In domain driven design we use Repositories to abstract the data access layer. Different Repositories often share the same behavior and their implementations often violate the DRY principle. In this section I will show how to refactor the repository concepts into an application’s supporting infrastructure to increase productivity, reusability and maintainability without sacrificing the flexibility of hand-rolled repositories.\n* Lazy About Lazy Loading. Repositories are commonly used in conjunction with object/relational mappers to increase separation of concerns. As the real-world concerns of software development manifest themselves, these abstractions start to leak and soon our domain services get tainted with fetching strategies and similar. In this section I will show how we can combine the concepts from previous sections with Inversion of Control to keep our models clean.\n* Wrap up. In this section the emphasis is on separation of concerns, the DRY-principle and the importance of keeping roles explicit.  ~5 minutes\n\nh1. Required experience\n\nAttendants should have at least a basic understanding of domain driven\ndesign to get full yield. The design principles and techniques\npresented are generally applicable, and can be of interest to\nattendants with out experiences with domain driven design.\n\nh1. Expected audience\n\nThis talk is directed towards developers and architects who practice\nor want to practice domain driven de- sign. It should also be of\ninterest to domain driven design skeptics who feel that this practice\nbring too much complexity into their designs.",

Being able to do non intrusive monitoring of method calls without access to the source code, performing this in a production environment without a noticeable performance hit? \n\nDo you want to know who is doing what to whom, that is, who invokes what method in context of which principal? Making certain that memory consumption is dynamically adjusted to avoid out of memory situations? Would you also like to use it in your legacy applications running pre Java 5 as well as utilize the new Java agent interface of the newer JVMs? \n\nYou know you have to collect vast amount of data and process it effectively and in real \ntime. Finally you figure out that the amount of data exceeds the capabilities of a \ntraditional data model and you decide that the only solution is a dimensional data model, \nusing MDX for multi dimensional analysis. \n\nThere are numerous tools available for profiling and measuring your Java programs. \nHowever these tools are either: a) aimed at profiling or measuring your code in a \ndevelopment environment; b) expensive; c) not open source; d) requires a Ph.D. in \ndebugging and profiling e) any combination of the above :-) \n\nUsemon (usemon.org) attempts to alleviate this by providing an open source tool which \nis easy to use, collects data from environments based upon Java 1.4 through 6, has a \nflexible dimensional data model stored in a SQL database and attempts to be \nnon-intrusive. \n\nUsemon hooks into the Java virtual machine through a modified class loader on older \nJVMs or via the Java Agent Interface from version 5 and up. It automatically monitors \nJava EE components (EJBs, Servlets, MDBs, Queues, SQL Statements, etc), but can be \nconfigured to inspect any class in your JVM. Data is multicasted from agents to one or \nmore collectors and stored in the DBMS of your choice. Usemon comes with a complete \nconfiguration for MySQL. \n\nThe overhead of running Usemon is negligible and thus you may collect run-time \nstatistics around the clock all year, which is rather fascinating, given that you have \nenough disk space. \n\nUsemon was developed for large Java EE environments at Telenor, which is one of the \nworlds largest telco to fulfill these requirements. You may utilize it in any environment in \nwhich you have control over the Java Virtual Machine start up parameters. For example \nJava EE applications, Spring based Web applications or simply your own home grown \nweb application packaged in a .war file.",

Denne asynkrone push-arkitekturen kalles gjerne \"Comet\".\n\nDette foredraget forklarer teknologien bak Comet, de nye mulighetene den tilbyr og utfordringene vi får på kjøpet. Foredraget tar utgangspunkt i servletcontaineren Jetty og Javascript-biblioteket Dojo. Sammen gjør disse det svært enkelt å utvikle Comet-baserte applikasjoner. Vi viser hvordan man kommer i gang med Comet og hvordan vi ved hjelp av Jetty og Dojo kan lage en webbasert chatapplikasjon på få minutter. Vi ser på flere eksempler der Comet er i produksjonskode og diskuterer ytelse og skalerbarhet i Jetty sin implementasjon. Vi viser også hvordan Comet støttes i forslaget til den kommende versjon 3.0 av Java Servlets-spesifikasjonen.\n\nh1. Outline:\n\n* Why Comet?\n** Increasing need for low latency, \"always current\" services\n** Limitations of Polling, Ajax\n* What is Comet?\n** Comet transports, long poll vs. streaming\n** Comet is HTTP\n** Asynchronuous IO (it's hard)\n** Bayeux protocol\n* Some Comet examples (Screensshots / live demos / screencasts)\n** SVNSearch real-time commits\n** live.chess.com\n** GMail\n** Distributed Paint clone implemented with Javascript and Comet.\n* About Jetty\n** Small, fast, testable, embeddable, and enjoyable open source servlet container.\n* About Dojo\n** Javascript toolkit\n** DOM manipulation, Effects, Widgets\n** Plugin based\n** Client side of Bayeux protocol implemented as a Dojo plugin\n* Chat example with Jetty and Dojo. (probably a mix of live coding and slides)\n** Create Maven project\n** Add Jetty, Dojo, Comet dependencies\n** Add ContinuationCometdServlet to web.xml\n** Adding a main method for Jetty with a SelectChannelConnector\n** Creating a simple chat application with Dojo\n* Comet performance and scalability\n** Greg's numbers?\n** 20.000 concurrent users\n** Comparison with polling\n* Comet limitations\n** Container support\n** OS/Container tuning (file descriptors, )\n** Firewalls\n** Proxying (Apache mod_proxy?)\n* The future\n** Servlet 3.0\n** Bayeux on Tomcat, Glassfish\n\nh1. Required experience:\n\nDeltakere bør ha kjennskap til web-progammering i Java og ha grunnleggende kunnskap om HTTP. Erfaring med Javascript er en fordel.",

Kanskje heldigvis, siden dokumentene ofte blir utdaterte over\ntid og dermed blir både ganske verdiløse og direkte skadelige.\n\nDokumentasjonsarbeid er tradisjonelt både kostnadskrevende og lite\nlystbetont arbeid. Hvilken type dokumentasjon er den viktigste?\nHvordan kan vi gjøre det både enklere, billigere og mer motiverende -\nog ikke minst, mer anvendelig?\n\nDette foredraget gir noen refleksjoner rundt temaet med konkrete\neksempler på hvordan dokumentasjonen kan gjøres mer levende gjennom en\nwiki integrert med andre utbredte støtteverktøy som Subversion og\nMaven. Vi ser også litt på modellbasert dokumentasjon med UML, hvordan\nkrav beskrives i brukstilfellemodeller, og hvordan arkitektur kan\ndokumenteres.",

These discussions resulted in a set of testing guidelines. The leaders of this task force started writing code to help implementing these guidelines. Unitils has emerged from concrete experience and lessons learned, with the ultimate goal of making unit testing easy, effective and maintainable. \nUnitils offers a lot of support in testing the database layer: automatic maintenance of test databases, automatic post-processing of the database to make it more test-friendly, loading test data using DbUnit and verifying the contents of the database after execution of a test. Unitils provides specific support for testing with JPA or hibernate, and offers integration with spring. It makes abstraction of the testing framework that is used for executing the tests, making it useable with JUnit3, JUnit4 or TestNG. \nBut Unitils is not limited to persistence layer testing only: The reflection assert utility is a very useful alternative to the classic assertEquals method with a range of leniency options. Unitils also provides superior support for dynamic mock objects, offering a simple syntax for specifying method behavior and verifying expectations.\nDuring this talk, I will present the different features of Unitils using simple, concrete examples. I will talk about problems from real projects and demonstrate how Unitils helps solving these problems.\n\nh1. Outline: \n* Introduction\n*  Feature overview: Using examples, I’ll demonstrate the features of Unitils: assertion using reflection, test data management, test database maintenance, JPA / hibernate and spring integration, testing with mock objects.\n* Demo: demonstration of the database maintainer, JPA / hibernate entity-database mapping test\n* Architecture: Provide some insight into how Unitils works.\n* Summary and roadmap: What are our plans for the future\n* Q & A\n\nh1.

Nettopp derfor er det så viktig at kunnskapen formidles på en slik måte at alle har de beste mulige forutsetninger for å lykkes med å lære. Ulike roller og bakgrunn er med på å skape et komplekst bilde med lærende og lærere.\n\nGjennom foredraget trekkes det paralleller mellom kunnskapsformidling internt i bedrifter, eksternt til kunder og til Bachelor studenter. Det pekes på utfordringer og muligheter knyttet til kunnskapsformidling og hva slags lærdom man kan ta med seg fra de ulike vinklingene. Man går også i dybden på den forskningsbaserte undervisningen som er et påkrevd fundament for alle høgskoler i Norge i dag og ser hvordan forskningsbasert opplæring kan være med på å gi kunnskapsøkning i bedrifter en ny dimensjon. Praktiske teknikker presenteres for å gi tilhørerne et konkret ”produkt” å ta med seg tilbake til egen hverdag.\n\nGjennom presentasjonen settes det fokus på teknikker som forskningsbasert undervisning og hva det vil si både å gjennomføre dette, men også hva man får ut av det. I tillegg vies det blant annet tid til å se på prosjektbasert læring og prinsipper rundt scaffolding (stillasbygging).\n\nNorges Informasjonsteknologiske Høgskole (NITH) utdanner Bachelor studenter innen\ninformasjonsteknologi og driver med forskning innen flere områder blant annet for å gi grunnlag for innovative og aktuelle utdanninger. NITH er den eneste høgskolen i Norge som har spesialisering på JEE5 og EJB 3.0 for sine programmeringsstudenter. I Mesan AS er det daglige utfordringer knyttet til kompetanseoverføring til kunder og andre eksterne aktører i prosjekter. Formidling av kunnskap er en av suksessfaktorene både for å kunne ha dynamiske, fungerende team og likedan for at man skal kunne ha en inkluderende dialog med kunde.",

        "summary": "h1. Abstract\n\nDeltakerne på denne sesjonen vil få innsikt i praksiser for effektivt å kommunisere og prioritere krav, estimere kostnader og gjennomføre utviklingsprosjekter. Ettersom dette er temaer uten fasitsvar legges det opp til mye diskusjon og interaksjon.\n\nProgramvareprosjekter mislykkes ofte med å levere lovede resultater, og kostnadsoverskridelser er en stor og hyppig utfordring. Mangelfull kravhåndtering er ofte en underliggende årsak til disse utfordringene. Det finnes imidlertid en rekke indikasjoner på at gode samarbeidspraksiser kan redusere omfanget på problemet. Det har vært anslått at samarbeid og kommunikasjon utgjør opptil 70% av den totale tidsbruken i programvareprosjekter, og  å anbefale en høy andel av samarbeid og kundeinvolvering er derfor ikke noe nytt. Utfordringen er imidlertid å identifisere hva som utgjør et godt samarbeid, og hvordan dette kan oppnås.\n\nMange utviklingsorganisasjoner benytter seg i økende grad av iterative og inkrementelle prosesser, for eksempel Scrum. Imidlertid har også de smidige prosessene, og andre prosesser slik som RUP, mangler når det gjelder å involvere sentrale aktører som kunder, interaksjonseksperter og brukertestere. De iterative og inkrementelle prosessene er unektelig bedre utrustet enn de sekvensielle prosessene (fossefall) når det kommer til å håndtere disse behovene, men de er samtidig også langt mer innstilt på å tilfredsstille behovene til utviklingsteamet.\n\nDenne sesjonen skisserer samarbeidspraksiser vi mener øker sjansen for verdiskapning i utviklingsprosjekter. Hovedfokuset er praksiser for å:\n\n* Definere en prosess som forbedrer prosjektgjennomføring\n* Kommunisere og samarbeide om kravhåndtering og forretningsprioritering\n* Samarbeide om estimering og planlegging\n\nEt overordnet prinsipp for diskusjonen vil være å skissere et rammeverk for kravhåndtering som illustreres gjennom en kommunikasjonspyramide. Denne pyramiden skiller mellom fem generiske nivåer for kommunikasjon om krav, som er nyttig i de fleste prosjekter. Disse er:\n\n* Forretningsmål\n* Overordnede krav\n* Detaljerte krav (f.eks. brukerhistorier)\n* Utviklingsoppgaver\n* Kildekode (f.eks. konkrete funksjoner)\n\nFor hvert nivå presenterer vi en oversikt over hvilke roller som typisk bør være involvert i kommunikasjon og samarbeid. Rollene som diskuteres inkluderer sluttbrukere, kunder, interaksjonsdesignere, utviklere, testere og prosjektledere. Det blir også presentert erfaringer fra et pågående forskning- og utviklingsprosjekt innenfor området.",

        "summary": "h1. Abstract:\n\nMario Aparicio og Eirik R. Larsen fra Ciber presenterer erfaringer med bruk av webrammeverket Seam og prosessmotoren jBPM. \n\nVRVask er et system utviklet av CIBER Norge for validering, manuell korrigering, og rapportering av store antall banktransaksjoner. Systemet er todelt og består av en batch-applikasjon og en web-applikasjon som kommuniserer gjennom en felles database. \n\nFor utvikling av web-applikasjonen ble webrammeverket Seam valgt. Bakgrunnen for dette valget er Seams abstraksjon av request / response modellen og støtte for lange brukerinteraksjoner, conversations. Batch-delen av løsningen ble utviklet som en standard Java-applikasjon med Spring og Hibernate.\n\nVi opplevde Seam som et godt valg av rammeverk for web-løsningen da det gav enkel integrasjon mellom webgrensesnitt, domene og database. På enkelte områder støtte vi imidlertid på utfordringer som muligens kunne vært løst bedre med andre rammeverk.  \n\nI utviklingen av batch-løsningen var Spring og Hibernate velegnede rammeverk for håndtering av database og dependency-injection. Derimot fikk vi problemer med håndtering av tilstandslogikk i batch-prosessen. Kompleksiteten ble undervurdert, og vi endte opp med å lagre tilstand i databasen og håndtere all tilstandslogikk programmatisk. Løsningen ble derfor vanskelig å utvikle og vedlikeholde. Etter å ha analysert problemene i batch-løsningen så vi at en prosessmotor med fordel kunne brukes for å håndtere tilstand. Vi valgte å se på prosessverktøyet jBPM da dette er et mye utprøvd verktøy som fungerer bra i et Java-miljø. jBPM er i tillegg godt integrert med andre JBoss-produkter som Hibernate og Seam. \n\nI presentasjonen beskriver vi positive og negative erfaringer med Seam i prosjektet og drøfter når det er fornuftig å bruke dette rammeverket fremfor andre web-rammeverk. Videre presenterer vi hvilke fordeler vi kan oppnå ved å bruke jBPM, og hvilke alternativer man har når man skal innføre et slikt verktøy i tilstandsfulle applikasjoner. Til slutt vil vi fremføre eksempler fra opprinnelig løsning og løsning med jBPM.",

Dependency injection, and inversion of control became well known terms, and it is difficult to imagine how we managed without them. But there is one aspect of the Spring framework that has been fiercely discussed for a long time; What is the best approach to configuring our applications for deployment in multiple environments?\n\nI have struggeled with this problem since my first encounter with the Spring framework, and over the years I have tried just about all the techniques there are. Some of them turned out to be bad - some of them turned out to be really bad. In this talk I will go through some of the techniques and approaches I have tried, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nBased on these trials and errors, I have put together a framework that aims to enhance the Spring container - enabling it to be differently configured for different target systems. I will demonstrate how you can use this framework to make your applications dramaticly easier to configure, easier to test, and less prone to malconfiguration in production and test environments.",

In order to produce something of value, we have to deliver reliable software into production. In an organization where the consequence of failure is great, we need to make sure that what we deliver works as intended. At the same time, even in a seemingly static world, many problems are hidden until the very end of the project. To make matters worse, complex technology and organizational processes inhibit our ability to act to new information with sufficient speed.\n\nThe talk shows how we can implement a rigorous, yet agile process. It is based around our experiences of putting the good idea of continuous integration and other agile methods into life and using this as the basis not just for the technical process, but for the whole improvement program for our organization. We have expanded our process to cover simulated production as a part of the testing effort. This way, we can guarantee that the actual delivery day will be uneventful.\n\nThe audience will come away from the talk with a good idea on how to improve their build process. The talk will cover both practical aspects, architectural changes that improves continuous integration, and what change you need to make in your organization to streamline the value chain from a code change to production readiness.",

Groovy, Jython og JRuby er eksempler på populære språk som fler og fler eksperimenterer med, og som bransjen er iferd med å ta i bruk. Felles for disse språkene er at kildekoden blir kompilert til Java Bytecode før den kan eksekveres på JVMen. \n\nMålet med dette foredraget er å gi en oversikt over veien fra kildekode til kjørende bytecode. Dette foredraget starter med en rask gjennomgang av kompilatorteknikk, etterfulgt av en gjennomgang av den fullstendige implementasjonen av et enkelt eget-utviklet språk - som kjører på JVMen. Vi vil forklare hvordan vi parser kildekoden og sjekker syntaktisk korrekthet. Neste steg blir å vise hvordan man genererer Java assembly-kode, som vi deretter bruker for generering av eksekverbar bytecode. \n\nForedraget vil være en teknisk sesjon, med live-demoer av kjernekonseptene. Vi vil runde av foredraget med en kort diskusjon av mulige motiver for å ville utvikle egne språk for VMen.",

MapReduce will be discussed. Real-life examples will \nbe discussed as well as common pitfalls, patterns and anti-patterns of using grid \ncomputing in real life. \nAfter introduction a comparison between GridGain and Hadoop (another popular \nMapReduce implementation) will be given with usual pros and cons of both \nprojects.\nTo underscore the topic of presentation it will also include live demonstration of \nwriting a simple application and grid enabling it to run on a small grid right in front \nof the audience. All coding during demonstration will be done live. Detailed and \nin-depth explanations will highlight that grid computing in Java can be fun, simple \nand productive to use in everyday applications and systems.",

Summary\nWe'll start by talking about how you can thumb your nose at The Man by leaving out many of the main syntactic hallmarks of Java: semicolons, parentheses, return statements, type declarations (aka duck-typing), even try/catch blocks. Of course, there's no way that we'd leave metaprogramming out of the discussion...\n\nWhat is metaprogramming? We'll add new methods to classes at runtime -- even if they were originally implemented in Java; even if they were declared final. (Thanks, ExpandoMetaClass!) We'll call methods that don't exist and avoid the dreaded MethodNotFound Exception. (Thanks, invokeMethod!) We'll narrowly scope our metaprogramming shenanigans using Use blocks and Categories, and then cast our changes to the wind such that every instance of a class gets our added juice.\n\nIf you are happy taking the Blue Pill, this talk is not for you. You can continue using Groovy as a slimmed-down dialect of Java -- an \"After\" picture to Java's \"Before\". If, however, the Red Pill looks interesting, please join me. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.\n\nh1. Expected audience:\nThis session is aimed squarely at Java developers. The more experience you have, the better, but even neophytes will appreciate what Groovy offers Java developers.\nExperience with other dynamic languages like Ruby, JavaScript, or Python will help, but certainly isn't required.\n\nh1. Required experience:\nYou should be comfortable with the basic syntactic rules of Java (so that we can mercilessly squash them). You should understand the basic \"Laws of Java\" when it comes to the semantics of a statically typed language (so that we can kick sand in its face). Most importantly, you should posses an open mind and a belly full of Dynamic-language KoolAid. This is not the forum for someone to vocally defend the merits of checked exceptions and static typing. You will be unceremoniously tossed out on your ear, Jerry Springer-style. Seriously. I'm not trying to convince you that this is the way you should write Java. The status quo can defend itself quite nicely, thank you very much. I'm here to show you how your code could look, if you so desire.",

        "content": "h1. Summary\nWe'll look at the dramatic reduction in line of code you can achieve by simply flipping your POJOs to POGOs (Plain Old Groovy Objects). We'll talk about calling Java classes from Groovy, and calling Groovy classes from Java. We'll look at Groovyc, the integrated compiler that manages Groovy/Java dependencies without a hiccup.\n\nThere are wild-eyed radicals out there telling you that Java is dead, statically-typed languages are passe, and your skills are hopelessly out-of-date. Those extremists are the same ones who don't bat an eye at throwing out years of experience to learn a new language from scratch, pushing aside a familiar IDE for a new one, and deploying to a whole new set of production servers with little regard to legacy integration.\n\nWhile this \"burn the boats\" approach to software development might sound exciting to some folks, it's giving your manager the cold shakes right now. What if I told you that there was a way that you could integrate seamlessly with your legacy Java code, continue to use your trusty IDE and stable production servers, and yet take advantage of many of the exciting new dynamic language features that those fanatics keep prattling on about? You'd probably say, \"Groovy!\" I would, too...\n\nNot once will I tell you to throw out the old in favor of the new. In each case, I'll show you how to integrate the new with the old. Don't throw out your Ant build scripts; mix in a bit of Groovy to spice 'em up. Don't toss out your existing unit tests. (You are unit testing, aren't you? AREN'T YOU?) If not, Groovy is the perfect excuse to get started with a new language in way that improves the quality of your Java application without actually putting the new code into production. That is, until you get hooked on doing things the Groovy way...\n\nIf the Red Pill of Dynamic Languages scares the pants off of you (or your manager), don't worry about it. The Blue Pill still offers plenty of benefits. There is no other language on the JVM that offers you the level of deep Java compatibility such that you could rename your \"dot J-A-V-A\" files to \"dot G-R-O-O-V-Y\" and not skip a beat. Of course, they both end up with a \"dot C-L-A-S-S\" extension at the end of the day, so there's good chance that no one would ever be the wiser anyway. Groovy: funny name, serious software, and Java through-and-through.\n\nh1. Expected audience:\nThis session is aimed squarely at Java developers. The more experience you have, the better, but even neophytes will appreciate what Groovy offers Java developers.\n\nh1. Required Experience:\nNothing more than standard Java knowledge.",

Abstract:\n\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides a fantastic way to deploy scalable machine images, but what to do when you want an application to scale across the machine images you have provisioned? This session discusses the Elastic Grid, an approach that provides dynamic allocation, management, and scalability of applications, using Amazon EC2 as the backbone. It also introduces the open-source technologies Elastic Grid is based on: Rio and Apache River (Jini™ network technology).\n\nThe Elastic Grid provides an architecture for developing, deploying, and managing distributed applications composed of services. Key to the architecture are a set of dynamic capabilities and reliance on policy-based and quality-of-service mechanisms. The Elastic Grid reduces the complexity surrounding the development of dynamic services by introducing Jini network technology remoting for POJOs as well as by providing a simple component model.\n\nThe Elastic Grid extends Amazon EC2's virtual grid environment, enabling users to manage and dynamically scale Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) based on declarable SLAs, as well as deal with partial failure of AMI instances. Rio reduces the complexity surrounding the development of dynamic services by introducing dynamic Jini network technology remoting for POJOs, as well as providing a simple component model.\n\nThe presentation demonstrates how IntelliJ plug-ins for Amazon EC2 and Rio ease building and deploying a sample application distributed over the Amazon EC2 grid. With the Elastic Grid solution, the application will scale on the Amazon EC2 grid by starting and stopping Amazon EC2 instances accordingly to declared SLAs (service-level agreements).",

The talk gathers on experiences from this and various other Objectware projects, putting together a good bunch of experiences, recommendations, guidelines and hints for getting your project's web-testing in order. \n\nTopics include: \n\n* Why web-tests are evil! \n* When should you NOT use web-tests \n* How many web-tests should you maintain? \n* How you can get the users to report bugs by writing tests for you \n* Getting a CI/testing server to run the tests for you \n* Combining web-tests with FitNesse acceptance testing \n* Behaviour Driven Development using RSpec with web-tests \n* Project testing strategy (and where web-tests fit in)",

Why would a Java programmer care about these technologies? How will it make you, as a programmer on the Java platform, more productive?\n\nOver the past two years. Ruby on Rails has brought the Ruby programming language into the mainstream. Ruby offers a cleaner, simpler, faster, and much more fun language for day-to-day development. Rails has changed the face of web development with legendary productivity gains and minimal configuration. The two are now available for your Java platform projects with JRuby, an implementation of Ruby for the JVM.\n\nIn this session, we'll walk through how you can get JRuby up and running. We'll demonstrate common use cases for JRuby like GUI development, web development with Ruby on Rails, and more. By the end of this session, you'll be ready to download JRuby and start adding it to your own projects, or start a few new ones. JRuby is ready for you!",

Abstract\n\nI sammenheng med utbygging av et kraftanlegg i Amazonas ble en indianer fra\nlokalbefolkningen trukket inn som vitne i rettsaken og stilt ovenfor den klassiske eden;\n\"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you\nGod?\". Han svarer; \"No, I can only tell you what I know\".\n\nVi som jobber med teknologi er alle meningsprodusenter idet vi lager en slags\nvirkelighet som brukerne må forholde seg til. Vi har derfor på mange måter stor\ninnflytelse i det å konstruere en virkelighet, en sannhet som mange brukere ikke setter\nspørsmålstegn ved. All teknologi handler mye om klassifikasjon av objekter og\nrelasjoner mellom objekter, kategorier etc. Klassifikasjon vil si å dele inn objekter,\npersoner, dyr eller andre fenomener etter kategorier eller typer. Et\nklassifikasjonssystem er en type kunnskap og kunnskap vil alltid ha et ideologisk aspekt.\nMen hvor bevisste er vi dette ansvaret?\n\nGjennom en kort introduksjon av de tidligste sosialantropologiske studier av\nmatklassifikasjon og totempæler vil jeg forsøke å vise at dagens semantiske web på\nmange måter er i tråd med disse tidligste fagteorienes hovedtanker, som for eksempel\ndet å se det enkelte system som avgrensede enheter, som kan studeres alene.\nAvleggere fra tidlige forsøk på å se kunnskap i lys av klassifikasjonssystemer skinner i\ndag gjennom hos flere teoretiske tilnærminger som det til stadighet refereres til og jeg\nvil argumentere for at det er dags for å trekke inn verktøy koblet mot en metodikk som\nbåde er i tråd med tida vi lever i og som løfter blikket fra studier av avgrensende enheter\nog som retter blikket mer mot brukerens egenartede og unike forståelse av det samme\nfenomenet.\n\nJeg er opptatt av å formidle tungt stoff på enkle måter – og vil bruke konkrete\neksempler for å få publikum med på det som kan kalles en faghistorisk charterreise med\nkonkrete eksempler hele veien for å illustrere poengene. De fleste vil nok sitte igjen med\nnoen aha‐opplevelser samt få ett innblikk i en fagverden man har mye til felles med til\ntross for at man sjelden kobler fag som teknologi og antropologi sammen. Jeg vil anta at\nfolk vil gjøre seg en og annen tanke – og trekke litt på smilebåndet!",

Rammebetingelsene for prosjektet var at kartserveren\nskulle være Java-basert og åpen kilde, slik at det ville være mulig å\ngjøre tilpasninger dersom det skulle være nødvendig. Videre var bare\nrene serverløsninger relevant siden klienten kom til å være\negenutviklet. Valgmulighetene var derfor veldig begrenset; i praksis\nkun GeoServer.\n\nSelve klienten bruker OpenLayers, et åpen kilde JavaScript-bibliotek\nsom støtter de viktigste protokollene. Det ble vurdert å utvikle en\negen kartklient i SWING, men dette ble forkastet på grunn av\nbegrensningene for minneforbruk i kjøremiljøet. Dette førte på sin tur\ntil et behov for å kunne sende kartdata fra web-basert kartklient til\nSWING-klient, som ble løst ved å la kartklienten gjøre et HTTP-kall\ntil SWING-klienten via en skjult IFRAME. Dermed var det heller ikke\nlenger nødvendig å bruke WFS-T- protokollen for å kjøre transaksjoner\nmed geodataene direkte mellom klient og server, slik at vi kunne\nbegrense løsningen til WMS. Det er mulig at det senere vil dukke opp\nkrav som gjør det likevel nødvendig å utvide løsningen med støtte for\nWFS-T, men dette vil ikke være et stort problem siden også WFS-T\nstøttes av GeoServer.\n\nTil slutt noen ord om plasseringen av GeoServer i vår arkitektur. I og\nmed at den står ved siden av integrasjonsplattformen og er koblet\ndirekte mot databasen bryter den med alle SOA-prinsipper, men\nalternativene viste seg å ikke fungere. En mulighet hadde vært å sette\nGeoServer foran integrasjonsplattformen, men dette hadde ført til økt\nrisiko og mye merarbeid i prosjektet siden GeoServer er bygget opp\nslik at den forventer direkte tilgang til databasen. Å inkludere\nGeoServer i integrasjonsplattformen var heller ikke en god løsning da\ndette hadde ført til ekstra arbeid for å kunne deploye GeoServer i\nplattformen.",

We will show specific use cases of\nQuercus such as using popular PHP applications like MediaWiki,\nWordPress, and Drupal directly, bridging existing Java and PHP\napplications, and using PHP as a view technology for Java. We will\nalso show the unique capabilities of the Quercus implementation\nsuch as transparent clustered sessions and use of Java objects\nnatively from PHP.

This presentation is my effort to give something back to the java community and hopefully start a discussionon how you should organize your maven projects.\n\nKeypoints:\n\n* What is the best way to keep buildtime down to a absolute minimum?\n* Should the modules be organized in vertical or horizontal modules?\n* How should you use a maven repository?\n* How do you handle releases\n* When should you create a new module?\n* What is the downsize of creating a new module?",

The open source Flex SDK and Java are a perfect combination of technologies for building rich, sexy software - for the web and the desktop.  Flex applications can run in the browser using the ubiquitous Flash Player or on the Desktop using the new Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). In both instances Java can be used for the back-end of the application. The communication between the Java back-end and Flex front-end can utilize a number of different communication protocols, but the easiest and best performing is the open source BlazeDS library.

        "summary": "h1. Abstract\n\nOver the past years, successful practitioners have applied Agile methods like Scrum and eXtreme Programming (XP) on individual projects to cut development lead times, improve product quality and reduce engineering cost. For instance, time-to-market reductions in the range of 30-50% have been reported by leading companies. Now, as these practitioners seek to expand on their initial successes, they face many complex obstacles posed by the realities of today's business environment: multiple organizational silos, distributed teams, interfacing with 'non-agile' vendors and customer organizations, continued cost cutting, complex product suites, and the pressing need for innovation. \n\nHow can agile practitioners apply the fundamental tenets of Agile - integrated small teams, small releases, sufficient-to-purpose, etc - to provide the next round of significant returns from their Agile investment? Sanjiv Augustine of LitheSpeed will lead a discussion on adopting a philosophy of smallness within bigness to allow the scaling of Agile practices beyond individual projects to deliver process improvements in complex environments with multiple projects.",

This is the quality seen by the user of the\nsoftware. The second part is the internal quality, also known as technical quality. This\nis the quality seen by the software engineers. The testing of software is often only\nbased on functional testing. Because the functional testing is driven by the functional\nrequirements, the functional quality is easy to test and easy to measure. The\ntechnical part of the software is almost ignored, because the technical quality is\nharder to test. But the technical quality directly affects the functional quality.\nSometimes you have non-functional requirements like response time for a certain\nfunction, but other non-functional requirements, like maintainability, are not\nmeasured.\nThe talk will give the attendees ideas how to “test” or measure the technical quality of\ntheir software. I will give answers concerning basic questions on software quality,\nsource code, object model, software metrics and their relationship. I will give a short\nintroduction into basic terms and I will give a short overview on basic metrics and\nmetrics on a higher, aggregated level. Then I will show some open source tools like\nPMD, ckjm, JDepend and will discuss the usage problems. Tools like SonarJ, Sonar\nand Xradar have more benefits. They consolidate the basic reports of the basic tools\nto create more readable and understandable reports of your software.\nThe talk will have a focus on practical methods. I will also give examples based on\ndaily project practice and the usage based on the open source tool XRadar\n(xradar.sourceforge.net). XRadar is a toolkit for quality analysis for java based\nsoftware project. It is a reporting tool based on many other open source toolkits like\nPMD or JDepend.\n\nMotivation (5min)\no Why do we need to control quality?\no What big problems do we face when developing software?\n·  What is technical Quality?

A comparison with a cake will\nmake it easy to understand: Not the optic and not the frosting on top of a cake\nguarantee a good taste and a healthy enjoyment. The ingredients, the recipe, the\nbaking itself, the enjoyment of the cake, the great treat of it to keep in memory and\nthe comfortable feeling afterwards are part of the total value and quality of the tasty\ncake. With the enjoyment of software is it likewise. The inner quality of software is\ncrucial for your success in software development projects. This talk gives answers\nwhy this kind of quality is so important and how to gain better technical quality using\ndifferent metrics based on the usage of the open source software XRadar (and\nothers).",

        "summary": "Resource Oriented Computing systems process resource representations, execute transformations and computations by defining processing in terms of compositions and asynchronous sequences of resource requests.  Application development and deployment using SOA faces problems when organizational changes occur if the participating systems (service providers and consumers) are too tightly coupled.  In SOA, messages and systems are inherently synchronous, promoting dependencies that filter to the organizational level.  Resource Oriented Computing solves system and application integration issues by leveraging ESB, domain-specific languages, and shared memory mechanisms for integrating coupling points, not the applications themselves, by promoting event-driven interactions between system components, and by creating logical mappings of resources such as data or computations that are abstracted from the physical manifestation of the system deployment.",

        "summary": "Apache Tapestry is an open source Java framework that combines the best features of two worlds: the heavy-duty performance and scalability of Java\n(not to mention its enterprise acceptance) with the productivity advantages of scripting languages such as Ruby.\n\nJava has emerged as the language for enterprise-class development: it has the widest adoption, the largest class libraries, the best performance, and\ngreatest degree of enterprise acceptance ... and yet, traditional web development is a painful, unproductive slog: large amounts of configuration combined with constant\nrecompiles and redeployments.\n\nPython and Ruby can be vastly more productive than Java but can't match Java in terms of performance and scalability, or acceptance in the enterprise.\n\nTapestry bridges the gap between these two worlds. It embraces convention over configuration on many levels. It enhances productivity with\nlive class reloading (changes to classes are picked up without a redeploy or restart) and best-of-breed exception reporting. Tapestry classes and templates\nare small, simple and immediately understandable. Tapestry applications are fast, efficient and highly scalable. Tapestry lets you work in terms of your objects\nand your methods: you can build entire applications and never think about a URL or a query parameter.  Things just work!\n\nTapestry is a component framework; we'll see how the built-in components provide broad functionality and yet are extremely extensible. Many of the components\nhave built-in Ajax functionality, and building your own components is a snap.\n\nThis session will feature live demonstrations and even a bit of live coding.  We'll demonstrate how Tapestry keeps you happy and productive like a Ruby or Python coder but still delivers\nthe results your boss and your customers need.",

Welcome to the event-driven Web—a system that addresses the architectural flaws of the Web, and facilities uninitiated server-side messaging. That's right! The event-driven Web does not necessitate a \"click\" to deliver content.\n\nWith this new paradigm, developers can initiate messages and events on the server—messages that are delivered to any type of Web client, including clients such as the iPhone, without the need for browser plug-ins or traditional polling. End-users receive streams of data, in real-time, making it possible to deliver data to clients as it arrives without the need to wait on a pool interval. Low latency delivery of information makes the Web an accommodating place for applications once thought to only be possible on the desktop, e.g., financial trading, auctions, sports betting, tools for analytics, business activity monitoring.\n\nTo understand the concept of event-driven Web, you first must understand its origins, the technologies and requirements behind it, its place in your applications, and the pitfalls. In this session, we will introduce you to all of the above with special focus on the pitfalls related to reversing the Web with an event-driven paradigm.\n\nConsiderations that we will discuss include connection limitations, network flooding, and scalability. In addition, attendees will be introduced to the various architectural options that are available to address these concerns. The techniques and technologies covered in this session include, but are not limited to Comet/Push implementations, Asynchronous Request Processing (ARP), and Java/JMS.",

Outline\n\nIn the past two years I presented the talks “The Top 10 Ways to Botch an Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application” and “The Top 10 Ways to Botch Enterprise Java Technology-Based Application Scalability and Reliability”. Now that people have plenty of expertise on how to botch their applications, I wanted to shift focus from anti-patterns to patterns. The \"Top 10\" theme remains as it keeps a quick pace and enforces a quick distillation of complex topics into simple concepts for the audience to remember.\n\nIn this presentation I will use real world examples to demonstrate the challenges, solutions, and unexpected discoveries architects find when building scalable Java applications. I will site actual scenarios where each pattern has been used, and explain what the driving forces were behind these choices. (This talk consciously steers clear of discussing website scaling via content caching, as this is a topic well-covered by many whitepapers, presentations and other conferences.\n\nA few examples:\n\nFor example, working on an ultra-low-latency JavaSpaces-based trading application was one of our first exposures to Recovery-Oriented Computing (ROC) for transaction processing in a production environment. The ROC concept can be used to achieve otherwise impossible results by selectively persisting only critical system state. Prior to this, we had generally steered clear of non-replicated in-memory data. But applying the ROC concept allowed us to achieve an order-of-magnitude latency improvement over what even the most efficient replicated-memory approach would have allowed, without compromising system availability.\n\nLikewise, working with a high-volume clearing application, a partner discovered that while serializable database isolation was required from a business perspective, and their database of choice enforced this optimistically, performing initial locking in-memory minimized the number of transaction rollbacks, substantially increasing system throughput.\n\nMuch of this experience was acquired while working with customers in the usual early-adopter sectors: websites for retail, travel and hospitality; transaction processing and compute grids in investment banks; and more recently, the rush of so-called \"Web 2.0\" startups. While in most of these cases, the primary reason for being onsite with the customer was the Coherence product that I am involved with, many of the more interesting lessons came from working with 3rd party products from dozens of vendors and open source communities, and learning alternate solutions to common problems from the people involved with those products.\n\nh1.

The specification introduces advanced coordination features such as portlet events standardizing inter portlet communication and public render parameters which allows several portlets to share the same render parameters. The new resource serving feature allows a portlet to deliver personalized resources to the browser such as images or PDF documents based on the current user preferences and profile, it also offers the capability to serve markup fragments from a portlet providing support for ajax portlet development. Portlets are now allowed to interact with the portal request and response with the possibility to read or write HTTP  headers and insert markup elements to the head section of the portal page. Others important features such as enhanced content caching and portlet filtering have been also introduced in the specification.",

Abstract\n\nDet utarbeides flere og flere selvadministrasjonsløsninger og det er et sterkt behov for å lage løsninger som gjør det mulig å tilby selvadministrasjon også får svært sensitive opplysninger, for eksempel helse opplysninger eller lignende. Data lagres ikke lenger i siloer slik som før og slik som Datatilsynet gjerne skulle ønske det. Denne presentasjonen gir deg konkrete råd om hvordan du kan lage et system som vil bli godkjent av Datatilsynet.\nForedaget vil ikke bare ha hovedfokus på java men den omkringliggende infrastrukturen som er nødvendig. Utviklere vil få forståelse av hva som bør være deres ansvar i en applikasjon og hva infrastrukturen bør støtte dem med for at systemet skal håndtere alle risikoer.",
